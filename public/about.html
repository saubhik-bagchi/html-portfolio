<p>Hi, I'm Akanksha Bagchi, a junior at WW-P High School North. I live in Plainsboro with my parents, and I am a STEM enthusiast.</p>

<p>I founded MindForge with a purpose to offer students a platform with equitable opportunities to explore STEM through research, mentorship, publications, competitions, and educational resources, fostering collaboration, leadership, innovation and academic growth in an inclusive environment.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me if you are interested to find more about MindForge, or if you are interested to join our community and contribute to taking our STEM initiatives to greater heights.</p>
